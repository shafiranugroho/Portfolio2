		<h5 id="down">01 |  Introduction</h5>
		<h6>As a delivery service platform, the “Good Food” application evolves around the food industry. Despite its wide range of audiences of ages 18-35 years, the “Good Food” particularly targets and provides for those in search to improve and maintain a healthy diet. Built through our platform’s approval and its customers’ feedbacks, the “Good Food” lets its users to browse and plan their diet through a healthy selected and approved product variety, detailed food descriptions  and its ‘reminder’ feature. Eating healthier only a click away. 

		Acting as both client and developer, my role in this project varies from investigation, design, testing and production. My tasks include: interviewing possible clients, research and analysing data, creation of personas and user stories/flows, construct wireframes and designs, and finally developing the application in Flinto as an active prototype.

		<h5>02 |  Competitive Analysis & Personas</h5>
		<h6>Understanding the market is essential for a new platform, especially with features that are similar to some. As a mobile application targeted towards users with interest in ordering healthier options of take-out, Good Food’s competitor include HealthyOut, Hello Fresh, Green Chef. As a result of the competitive analysis, we learn what users value most:
			<ul>
				<li>Differentiation - suitable atmosphere (often associated with earthy or bright colors),</li>
				<li>Browsing meal plans according to their specific diet,</li>
				<li>Diagrams and Images,</li>
				<li>Simple content (per page),</li>
			</ul>
		</h6></div>

		<div class="container-text">
		<h6>Despite learning that most possible users took interest in managing their diet and thus taking the turn into a healthier take-out application, there were still plenty of characters with the same target. After two rounds of surveys and (one-on-one) interviews, the possible users of Good Food was narrowed down to 3 personas. Which are: the newly-independent student, travelling business person, responsible homeparents. </h6>

		<h5>04 |  Differentiation & Branding</h5>
		<h6>Despite the varying characters or personas, they are all identical in terms of their goal or demand. They all want to achieve or simply have access to a platform that can help them maintain a healthier diet. This single similarity, brings the idea of the application differentiation plan. First, the application aims to achieve differentiation in terms of successfully carrying the concept in a mobile application (since most competitors are only available via desktop.), in order to achieve optimum accessibility for all types of potential users.  Second, the application will include a key feature that is the meal-planning and scheduled delivery feature. The third plan notices the visual aspect of the application. The Good Food aims differentiation through disregarding the conventional green-packed color scheme. Instead, whilst still keeping the fresh and bright tone, its color scheme will revolve around yellow.

	<div class="container-text">
	<h6>Initially, a fourth factor was to be featured in the application.However, after further discussions (with my mentor) and research, the feature was eliminated. It was planned that the application will further its differentiation plan through its own unique gesture-based design. Unfortunately, the idea did not pass because the concept demanded liability on the users - which in a sense, completely disregards the works of a UX designer. </h6></div>

		<h5>05 |  Modern vs Dated Designing (Wireframing)</h5>
		<h6>Like any other, creating Good Food’s wireframes helps visualizes the final prototype. This includes consideration of the layout and its usability- its flow, therefore requires understanding proportions and positioning. At this point of the process, through mistakes and evaluation,  I learned the details and the differences of a dated and new platform. Though navigation testing of these wireframes proved success, I found flaws after additional research and discussion. Directed by my mentor to a examples on Landbook, we further discussed the details that make a design look less-dated. Since the low-fidelity wireframes were not the most detailed diagrams, the problem was only evaluated and recognized in the high-fidelity wireframes. Many of the features I implemented in the application were considered “dated” because of the many missing detailed, that collectively created such atmosphere. I learnt a few key points on creating “new” mobile designs, including:

		<ul>
				<li>Importance of Font and Sizing</li>
				<li>Implementing Shadow & Shadow-drops details</li>
				<li>Rounded edges</li>
				<li>Choice of Color and shades </li>
				<li>Icons </li>
				<li>Spacing </li>
			</ul>

		<div class="record"><center><video width="300" controls Autoplay=autoplay>

		<h6>This project marks my first Flinto prototype. The application lets its users sync mock-ups from sketch; unfortunately, inexperienced with the platform, I decided to create my initial mock-up on adobe illustrator. Subsequently, I had to remake the mock-up directly on Flinto. On the positive side, this impromptu design remake, gave me the chance to reflect on my choices of design. After further discussions and additional user testings, whilst the redesign, gave me the opportunity to add or remove features along the way. At the end, the final platform performs necessary features with best selected aesthetic/layout. </h6>

		<h5>07 |  Conclusion</h5>
		<h6>As my first mobile based platform, Good Food was a successful experimental project. One of the most important lessons learnt throughout this experience, is teaching the eye to comprehend the difference between modern and dated design. Though modern designs does not always mean articulating completely new ideas, it does require focus on particular details that collectively capture such modern atmosphere. These details include specific features, such as: shadow drops, color, fonts, rounded edges, etc. Being an ambitious person, I oftentimes challenge to create new ideas/concepts; and with that alone, this creation of modern delicate details is a perseverance challenge. Nonetheless, I acquired my creativity in this project through implementing and enhancing the feature of delivery scheduling. Essentially, this additional feature grounds the basis of the application’s differentiation plan - the weekly meal planner. </h6>
